m Learning(PLTL)

PLTL is a course management website that gives specific functionality to TA's(leaders). This site was a term project for a Graduate course on advanced
internet technology at the [City College of New York]. Before this course, 
neither myself or the rest of my teamates had any experience building websites using Django as a Framework. That being said, we did a pretty good job!
